<h3>Rectangular Board Signs</h3>
<p>Rectangular Board Signs are called Informative Signs.
Informative signs also called guide signs, are provided to assist the drivers to reach their desired destinations.<br>
These are predominantly meant for the drivers who are unfamiliar to the place.
The guide signs are redundant for the users who are accustomed to the location.<br><br>
Some of the examples for these type of signs are route markers, destination signs, mile posts, 
service information, recreational and cultural interest area signing etc.<br>
Route markers are used to identify numbered highways. 
They have designs that are distinctive and unique.
They are written black letters on yellow background.<br>
Destination signs are used to indicate the direction to the critical destination points, and to mark important intersections.
Distance in kilometers are sometimes marked to the right side of the destination.<br>
They are, in general, rectangular with the long dimension in the horizontal direction.
They are color coded as white letters with green background.</p>
